# Why would ArenA prefabricateds need a custom MRP II instead of using an of the shelf solution?

I listed some reasons that ChatGPT have addressed that are almost identical to the ones i was thinking about

A manufacturing business might require a custom ERP solution instead of an off-the-shelf one due to specific needs and challenges unique to its operations. Here are some key reasons:

### 1. **Unique Manufacturing Processes**
   - Many manufacturing businesses have highly specialized workflows, production techniques, or assembly lines that standard ERP systems cannot fully accommodate.
   - A custom ERP can be tailored to support proprietary processes, ensuring better efficiency and alignment with operational requirements.

### 2. **Integration with Existing Systems**
   - Manufacturing firms often use legacy systems or custom software for inventory management, production scheduling, or quality control.
   - A custom ERP can seamlessly integrate with these systems, reducing the risk of disruptions and ensuring smooth data flow.

### 3. **Scalability and Flexibility**
   - Prebuilt ERP solutions may be rigid or require costly upgrades as the business grows or diversifies.
   - Custom ERP systems can be designed to scale and adapt to changes in the business model, production volumes, or market demands.

### 4. **Specific Industry Compliance**
   - Manufacturing businesses may need to adhere to strict industry-specific regulations and standards (e.g., ISO, FDA, environmental regulations).
   - A custom ERP can incorporate compliance features tailored to the industry, automating reporting and ensuring adherence to regulations.

### 5. **Enhanced Reporting and Analytics**
   - Standard ERP solutions may not provide the level of granularity needed for certain manufacturing metrics, such as real-time machine performance, yield rates, or energy consumption.
   - A custom ERP can include detailed dashboards and analytics tools relevant to the business's priorities.

### 6. **Cost Efficiency in the Long Run**
   - While custom ERP development involves higher initial costs, it can be more cost-effective over time by eliminating the need for expensive modifications or recurring licensing fees typical of off-the-shelf solutions.

### 7. **Customer and Supplier Relationships**
   - Manufacturing businesses often require deep integration with customer and supplier systems for order tracking, inventory management, or production schedules.
   - A custom ERP can include unique features that improve collaboration and data sharing with these external stakeholders.

### 8. **User Experience and Training**
   - Custom ERPs can be designed with a user-friendly interface tailored to the skill level of the business's workforce, reducing training time and improving adoption rates.

### 9. **Competitive Advantage**
   - By implementing an ERP designed to optimize specific processes and operations, the business can achieve efficiencies that give it an edge over competitors using generic systems.

### 10. **Security and Data Ownership**
   - Custom solutions provide more control over data security, allowing the company to implement stricter measures and retain full ownership of sensitive business information.

While off-the-shelf ERPs can be customized to some extent, they may still fall short in addressing highly specialized requirements or might involve significant ongoing costs for customization and maintenance. A custom ERP solution provides the flexibility to mold the software precisely to the businessâ€™s needs, ensuring better alignment with strategic goals.

# My analysis 

Has to be known that, although modern ERPs are very customizable, the customization process is tedious and
often need some workarounds to answer to the specific requirements of a business. 

The ArenA factory might have some non standardized processes that cannot be handle by professional ERPs, 
which assume the business follows certain rules.

Although it was already stated, the cost is an important factor, as most of the existent ERPs come with an
elevated cost that grows with the quantity of users, being limited in how many people can get involved in the 
processes. It has to be known that initially, for the first years, the cost will be similar.

Specialized software lets the user have specific workflows that makes it easy to use. Instead of filling an inventory,
for example, the user might be requested to register a bricks burning with easy and common language that even
unexperienced users can understand, letting the software fill the corresponding inventories based on the gathered information
